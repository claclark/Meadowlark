# Meadowlark

**Meadowlark** is a Python wrapper for [Cottontail](https://github.com/claclark/Cottontail), a flexible and efficient indexing library written in C++. Meadowlark exposes a minimal interface to Cottontail using `pybind11`, with additional conventions for handling annotations in Python.

Or that's the idea. Not much to see yet.
